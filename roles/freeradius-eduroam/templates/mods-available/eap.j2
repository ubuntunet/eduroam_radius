#  Whatever you do, do NOT set 'Auth-Type := EAP'.  The server
#  is smart enough to figure this out on its own.  The most
#  common side effect of setting 'Auth-Type := EAP' is that the
#  users then cannot use ANY other authentication method.

	#  Note that you should NOT use a globally known CA here!
	#  e.g. using a Verisign cert as a "known CA" means that
	#  ANYONE who has a certificate signed by them can
	#  authenticate via EAP-TLS!  This is likely not what you want.

	#  If you see the server send an Access-Challenge,
	#  and the client never sends another Access-Request,
	#  then
	#
	#		STOP!

	#  The server certificate has to have special OID's
	#  in it, or else the Microsoft clients will silently
	#  fail.  See the "scripts/xpextensions" file for
